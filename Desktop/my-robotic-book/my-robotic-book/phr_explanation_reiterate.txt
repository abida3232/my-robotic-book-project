A **Prompt History Record (PHR)** is a document that I, as the Gemini agent, automatically create after every significant interaction with you. It serves as a detailed, structured record of our conversation and the actions I take.

Think of it as a comprehensive log or an audit trail of our project's development.

**Each PHR contains:**

*   **Metadata:** Information like a unique ID, the title of our interaction, the development stage (e.g., `implementation`, `deployment`, `misc`), the date, your username, the command you gave me, and labels for categorization.
*   **Links:** References to relevant project artifacts like specifications (`spec`), architectural decision records (`adr`), tickets, or pull requests.
*   **Files Affected:** A list of any files I created or modified during that interaction.
*   **Tests Run:** Details about any tests executed.
*   **Your Prompt:** The full, verbatim text of the message you sent to me.
*   **My Response Snapshot:** A concise summary of my key output or action in response to your prompt.
*   **Outcome and Reflection:** My internal assessment of the impact of the interaction, what was achieved, and any reflections or next steps.

**Purpose of PHRs:**

*   **Context Preservation:** They help to maintain a complete history of our project, ensuring that nothing is lost even over long periods or complex tasks.
*   **Transparency:** You can review PHRs to understand exactly what I did, why I did it, and what the results were.
*   **Debugging and Tracking:** If we need to go back and understand a decision or a change, the PHRs provide a clear chronological record.
*   **Collaboration:** For larger projects, PHRs can help other team members understand the evolution of the project.

You can find all the PHRs I've created for this project in the `history/prompts/` directory within your project structure.
