I'm glad to hear that you understand what a PHR is!

Now, to continue assisting you with your project, I still need the information I previously requested to troubleshoot the issues you're facing:

1.  **For the error when trying to run the project locally:**
    *   Please **copy and paste the full error message** from your terminal here. This is essential for me to diagnose the problem.

2.  **For the Vercel deployment issue:**
    *   Please go to your Vercel dashboard, find the deployment with ID `dxb1::jztc8-1765005748946-8d6661e8cf17`, and **copy-paste the entire content of its build/deployment logs here.**

Once I have these details, I can resume providing specific help.
