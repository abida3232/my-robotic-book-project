I understand you want to see your project running locally.

Once again, as a text-based CLI agent, I cannot **display** your project in a web browser for you. My output is text.

To see your project running on your local system, you **must** start the development server yourself in your terminal and then open your web browser.

**Here is the command you need to run in your *own* terminal:**

1.  **Open your system's terminal** (e.g., PowerShell, Command Prompt, Git Bash).
2.  **Navigate to your project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd C:\Users\ABC\Desktop\my-robotic-book\my-robotic-book\
    ```
3.  **Run the Docusaurus start command:**
    ```bash
    npm start --prefix my-robotic-book
    ```
    *   **Wait for the server to start.** You will see messages in your terminal indicating it's building and then serving the site.
4.  **Open your web browser** and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

This is the only way for you to "see" your project on your local system. I cannot perform these actions for you directly.
