To continue, I need you to provide the specific information I've requested in our earlier interactions. This information is crucial for me to understand and help resolve the deployment issues you're experiencing with GitHub and Vercel.

Specifically, I am waiting for:

1.  **Regarding the "empty repo" on GitHub:**
    *   **Confirmation of the GitHub branch you are viewing.** Please tell me if you are looking at the `master` branch, `gh-pages` branch, or another branch.
    *   **The exact content or a screenshot of what you see** when you browse your repository on GitHub. This will help me understand why you perceive it as "empty."
    *   **Confirmation of whether you have attempted the manual deployment steps for GitHub Pages** that I provided earlier (building the site and then force-pushing the `build` directory to the `gh-pages` branch).

2.  **Regarding the Vercel deployment issue:**
    *   **The full deployment logs from Vercel.** Please go to your Vercel dashboard, find the deployment with ID `dxb1::jztc8-1765005748946-8d6661e8cf17`, and **copy-paste the entire content of its build/deployment logs here.** This is the most critical piece of information for troubleshooting Vercel.

Once you provide these details, I will be able to analyze them and suggest the next steps or solutions. Without this information, I cannot effectively continue.
