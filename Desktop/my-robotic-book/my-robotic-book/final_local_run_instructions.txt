I understand you want to see an overview of your project by running it on your local host. I am here to help you get it running, but please understand that **I cannot directly execute the command for you, nor can I display the graphical output in this text-based interface.** You need to run the command in your own terminal.

**To run your project on your local host (typically `http://localhost:3000`), please follow these steps carefully on your own system:**

1.  **Open your system's terminal** (e.g., PowerShell, Command Prompt, Git Bash).
2.  **Navigate to your project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd C:\Users\ABC\Desktop\my-robotic-book\my-robotic-book\
    ```
3.  **Execute the Docusaurus start command:**
    ```bash
    npm start --prefix my-robotic-book
    ```
    *   This command will start the development server. You should see various messages in your terminal indicating that the build is progressing.
    *   If it asks you to install missing dependencies, type `y` and press Enter.

4.  **Open your web browser:** Once the command runs successfully and the server is active, open your preferred web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
5.  **Go to the local host URL:** In your browser's address bar, type `http://localhost:3000` and press Enter.

You should then see your project (the book content) displayed in your browser. This is how you can "see your project overview" on your local system.

Please let me know if you run into any specific errors when you execute `npm start` in your terminal.
