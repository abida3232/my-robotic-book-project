It\'s a powerful and highly realistic simulation environment designed to accelerate the development, testing, and deployment of AI-driven robots. Unlike traditional simulators that might focus solely on physics, Isaac Sim integrates high-fidelity graphics, sensor simulation, and advanced physics to create digital twins of real-world environments, enabling complex robotic tasks to be trained and validated in a virtual space.","sidebar":"bookSidebar"},"part3-simulation/chapter9-perception":{"id":"part3-simulation/chapter9-perception","title":"Chapter 9 - Perception in Simulated Environments","description":"Perception is one of the foundational pillars of intelligent robotic behavior, enabling robots to understand their surroundings and make informed decisions. In the context of Physical AI, simulated environments play a pivotal role in the development and testing of robust perception systems. High-fidelity simulators like Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim provide a controlled, reproducible, and scalable platform for generating realistic sensor data, accessing ground truth information, and iterating rapidly on perception algorithms.","sidebar":"bookSidebar"},"tutorial-basics/congratulations":{"id":"tutorial-basics/congratulations","title":"Congratulations!","description":"You have just learned the basics of Docusaurus and made some changes to the initial template."},"tutorial-basics/create-a-blog-post":{"id":"tutorial-basics/create-a-blog-post","title":"Create a Blog Post","description":"Docusaurus creates a page for each blog post, but also a blog index page, a tag system, an RSS feed..."},"tutorial-basics/create-a-document":{"id":"tutorial-basics/create-a-document","title":"Create a Document","description":"Documents are groups of pages connected through:"},"tutorial-basics/create-a-page":{"id":"tutorial-basics/create-a-page","title":"Create a Page","description":"Add Markdown or React files to src/pages to create a standalone page:"},"tutorial-basics/deploy-your-site":{"id":"tutorial-basics/deploy-your-site","title":"Deploy your site","description":"Docusaurus is a static-site-generator (also called Jamstack)."},"tutorial-basics/markdown-features":{"id":"tutorial-basics/markdown-features","title":"Markdown Features","description":"Docusaurus supports Markdown and a few additional features."},"tutorial-extras/manage-docs-versions":{"id":"tutorial-extras/manage-docs-versions","title":"Manage Docs Versions","description":"Docusaurus can manage multiple versions of your docs."},"tutorial-extras/translate-your-site":{"id":"tutorial-extras/translate-your-site","title":"Translate your site","description":"Let\'s translate docs/intro.md to French."}}}}')}}]);
