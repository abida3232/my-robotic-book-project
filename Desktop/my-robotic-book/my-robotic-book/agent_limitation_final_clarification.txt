I understand you wish to see the project. However, as a text-based command-line interface (CLI) agent, I inherently **cannot graphically display** a website preview, images, or any visual content directly within this terminal.

My responses are limited to text.

To "show" you the project, I can only provide instructions for *you* to follow on *your* system, such as:

*   **Commands to run** in your terminal.
*   **URLs to open** in your web browser.
*   **Text content** from files.

I have provided you with detailed instructions multiple times on how to:
1.  **Run your project locally** and view it in your own web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  **Access the GitHub repository** for the project's source code.
3.  **Find deployment URLs** on GitHub Pages (after you complete the deployment steps).
4.  **Find deployment logs** on Vercel (after you complete the deployment steps).

Please let me know if you would like me to clarify any of those instructions, or if you have encountered a specific error while trying to follow them.
