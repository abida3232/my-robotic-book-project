Thank you for providing the ID again: `dxb1::jztc8-1765005748946-8d6661e8cf17`.

This string appears to be a **deployment or build ID** from Vercel, not an error message itself. This ID is a reference that you can use to find the details of that specific deployment on your Vercel dashboard.

To understand why your deployment might not be working as expected, you need to check the **deployment logs** on Vercel associated with this ID. The logs will contain the actual errors or warnings that occurred during the build and deployment process.

**Here's how you can find the deployment logs on Vercel:**

1.  **Go to your Vercel Dashboard:** Open your web browser and go to `vercel.com/dashboard`.
2.  **Navigate to your Project:** Find and click on the specific project (`my-robotic-book-project`) that you are trying to deploy.
3.  **Find the Deployment:** On the project's overview page, you should see a list of your deployments. Look for the deployment that corresponds to the ID `dxb1::jztc8-1765005748946-8d6661e8cf17`. It might be listed with a status like "Failed," "Error," or "Canceled."
4.  **View the Logs:** Click on that specific deployment. You will then see a detailed view of the deployment process, including the build logs. The logs will show you the exact output from the build command (e.g., `npm run build`), including any errors that prevented the site from deploying successfully.

Please share the **content of those logs** with me, especially any lines marked as `error`, `failed`, or `warning`, so I can help you troubleshoot the issue.
