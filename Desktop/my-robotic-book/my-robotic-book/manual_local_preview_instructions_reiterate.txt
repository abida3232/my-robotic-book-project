I understand you want to see your project on `http://localhost:3000`.

However, as a text-based CLI agent, I cannot directly "show" you a graphical preview of the Docusaurus book in this interface. Also, I am unable to execute the `npm start` command from within this environment due to ongoing issues with command recognition (as indicated by the "'docusaurus' is not recognized" error).

To view your project on `http://localhost:3000`, you need to execute the command yourself in your local terminal.

**Please follow these steps on your own system:**

1.  **Open your system's terminal** (e.g., PowerShell, Command Prompt, Git Bash).
2.  **Navigate to your project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd C:\Users\ABC\Desktop\my-robotic-book\my-robotic-book\
    ```
3.  **Run the Docusaurus start command:**
    ```bash
    npm start --prefix my-robotic-book
    ```
4.  Once the server starts (it will show messages in your terminal), **open your web browser** and go to `http://localhost:3000`. This is where you will see the book's content.

Please let me know if you encounter any issues while trying to start the server or if you have any questions about the content once you view it.
