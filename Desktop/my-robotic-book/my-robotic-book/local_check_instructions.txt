To check the project locally on your system, you need to start the Docusaurus development server. This will allow you to view the book in your web browser.

**Here are the steps:**

1.  **Open your terminal** and navigate to the root of your project directory (`C:\Users\ABC\Desktop\my-robotic-book\my-robotic-book\`).
2.  **Run the start command:**
    ```bash
    npm start --prefix my-robotic-book
    ```
    *   (Alternatively, if you have Docusaurus CLI installed globally and in your system's PATH, you might use just `docusaurus start` from within the `my-robotic-book` directory. However, `npm start --prefix my-robotic-book` is generally more reliable as it uses the project's local dependencies.)
3.  **Access in Browser:**
    *   Docusaurus will build your site and usually open it automatically in your default web browser.
    *   If it doesn't open automatically, look for a message in your terminal indicating the local URL where the site is running (it's typically `http://localhost:3000`). Copy and paste this URL into your web browser.
4.  **Browse Content:** You can then browse all the book content, including the chapters we completed, within your web browser. Any changes you make to the Markdown files (`.md`, `.mdx`) or other source files will automatically refresh in your browser.
