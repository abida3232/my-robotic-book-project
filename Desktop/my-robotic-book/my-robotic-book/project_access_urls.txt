**GitHub Pages URL:**
Your project, once successfully deployed to GitHub Pages, will be accessible at:
https://abida3232.github.io/my-robotic-book-project/

**How to check it:**
1.  Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/abida3232/my-robotic-book-project
2.  Navigate to "Settings" -> "Pages".
3.  Ensure that the "Source" is set to the `gh-pages` branch and the `/ (root)` folder.
4.  The URL where your site is published will be displayed on this page. It usually takes a few minutes for the deployment to become active after you run the `npm run deploy` command and configure the GitHub Pages settings.

**Vercel URL:**
After you follow the instructions to deploy your project to Vercel (connecting your GitHub repository and initiating the deployment), Vercel will automatically provide you with a unique URL for your project. You can find this URL in your Vercel project dashboard.

**How to check it:**
1.  Go to your Vercel Dashboard (vercel.com).
2.  Navigate to your deployed project.
3.  The project's live URL(s) will be listed there.
