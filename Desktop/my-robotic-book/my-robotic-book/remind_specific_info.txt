I understand you are doing what is necessary. To clarify, "doing what is necessary" from my perspective right now means providing the specific details I requested in the previous turn.

Specifically, I need:

1.  **Confirmation and details about your GitHub repository:**
    *   Which branch are you viewing on GitHub when you see an "empty repo"?
    *   Can you share the exact content or a screenshot of what you see on your GitHub repository page?
    *   Have you attempted the manual deployment steps for GitHub Pages that I provided?

2.  **The full deployment logs from Vercel:**
    *   Please go to your Vercel dashboard, find the deployment with ID `dxb1::jztc8-1765005748946-8d6661e8cf17`, and **copy-paste the entire content of its build/deployment logs here.** This is crucial for understanding why it might be failing.

Without these specific pieces of information, I am unable to diagnose the issues further or provide concrete solutions. Please provide these details so I can continue to assist you.
