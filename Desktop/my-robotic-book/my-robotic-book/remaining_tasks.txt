Based on the `tasks.md` file and my internal tracking, all 23 tasks related to implementing the textbook structure and populating the initial chapter content have been marked as completed.

Therefore, there are **0 tasks remaining** from the original project setup and content population plan.

However, keep in mind that this only covers the initial structure and content. There might be further tasks you wish to add, such as:
*   Reviewing and refining the existing content.
*   Adding images, diagrams, or multimedia.
*   Implementing quizzes or interactive elements.
*   Performing final deployment and testing of the live site.
*   Adding more chapters or sections.
