I am unable to directly execute the `npm start` command from within this environment due to ongoing issues with command recognition (as indicated by the "'docusaurus' is not recognized" error).

To see the book on your local system, you need to execute the command yourself in your local terminal.

**Please follow these steps on your own system:**

1.  **Open your system's terminal** (e.g., PowerShell, Command Prompt, Git Bash).
2.  **Navigate to your project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd C:\Users\ABC\Desktop\my-robotic-book\my-robotic-book\
    ```
3.  **Run the Docusaurus start command:**
    ```bash
    npm start --prefix my-robotic-book
    ```
4.  Once the server starts (it will show messages in your terminal), **open your web browser** and go to `http://localhost:3000`. This is where you will see the book's content.

I apologize for not being able to run this command directly for you.
