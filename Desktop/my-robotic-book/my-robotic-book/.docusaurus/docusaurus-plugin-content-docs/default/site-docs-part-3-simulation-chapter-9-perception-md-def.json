  "description": "Perception is one of the foundational pillars of intelligent robotic behavior, enabling robots to understand their surroundings and make informed decisions. In the context of Physical AI, simulated environments play a pivotal role in the development and testing of robust perception systems. High-fidelity simulators like Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim provide a controlled, reproducible, and scalable platform for generating realistic sensor data, accessing ground truth information, and iterating rapidly on perception algorithms.",
