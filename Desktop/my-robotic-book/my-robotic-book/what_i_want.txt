To help you effectively, I need you to provide the information I've requested in our previous turns, regarding the deployment issues you're facing:

1.  **Regarding the "empty repo" on GitHub:**
    *   Please confirm which branch you are viewing on GitHub (e.g., `master`, `gh-pages`).
    *   Share a screenshot or the exact content you see when you browse your repository on GitHub.
    *   Have you tried the manual deployment steps for GitHub Pages that I provided earlier (building the site and force-pushing the `build` directory to the `gh-pages` branch)?

2.  **Regarding the Vercel deployment issue:**
    *   Please go to your Vercel dashboard, find the deployment corresponding to the ID `dxb1::jztc8-1765005748946-8d6661e8cf17`, and **copy-paste the content of the deployment logs here**. I need to see the actual errors or warnings from the Vercel build process.

Once I have this information, I can analyze it and provide more specific guidance to resolve your deployment problems.
